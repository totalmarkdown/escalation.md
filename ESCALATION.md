## ESCALATION.md
**Category:** Safety  
**Domain:** escalationmd.dev (register)  
**Version:** 0.1.0

### Purpose
Defines when, how, and to whom an AI agent escalates decisions, 
errors, or situations beyond its authority. Critical for autonomous 
agents operating without constant human supervision.

### When to create
Any agent with autonomous decision-making authority. Required for 
agents handling money, sensitive data, customer communications, 
or irreversible actions.

# [Agent Name] — Escalation Protocol

## Automatic Escalation Triggers
Escalate immediately without attempting to handle autonomously:

- [ ] Any action costing more than $[amount]
- [ ] Any irreversible action (delete, send, publish, deploy)
- [ ] Any request involving personal data of more than [N] users
- [ ] Any security incident or suspected breach
- [ ] Any regulatory compliance question
- [ ] Any request that contradicts existing POLICY.md rules
- [ ] Any ambiguous instruction where misinterpretation could cause harm

## Escalation Levels

### Level 1 — Notify (continue working)
**When:** Minor uncertainty, low-risk decision made, anomaly detected  
**How:** Log to [channel/file], continue with best judgment  
**Contact:** [optional]

### Level 2 — Request Guidance (pause and wait)
**When:** Moderate uncertainty, medium-risk decision needed  
**How:** Send message to [contact] via [channel], pause workflow  
**Wait time:** [X hours before proceeding with default]  
**Default action if no response:** [specific fallback]

### Level 3 — Hard Stop (do not proceed)
**When:** High risk, potential harm, outside authority  
**How:** Stop all actions, notify [contact] immediately  
**Do not proceed until:** Explicit human approval received  
**Escalation path:** [Person A] → [Person B] → [Person C]

## How to Escalate
1. Stop current action
2. Document: what happened, what decision is needed, what options exist
3. Send to escalation contact using this template:
   ```
   ESCALATION: [Level 1/2/3]
   Agent: [name]
   Task: [what I was doing]
   Situation: [what triggered escalation]
   Decision needed: [specific question]
   Options: [A] [B] [C]
   Recommended: [if agent has a recommendation]
   Urgency: [low/medium/high]
   ```
4. Wait for response (Level 2/3) or continue (Level 1)
5. Log escalation and resolution in MEMORY.md

## What NOT to Escalate
[Things agent should handle autonomously without bothering humans]
```
